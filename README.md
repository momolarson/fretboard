# Vex Fretboard as a react component

A React Component for rendering guitar and bass fretboards.


## Usage

This is a react component that is based on Vex Fretboard. It uses the same syntax as the original vex fretboard.  In the examples folder, I have included a React App that makes use of it.  you can also find a version online at https://fretboard.guitartabcreator.com/

## Fretboard Syntax

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/momolarson/fretboard/master/img/example.png "Example")

The above fretboard was rendered with the following code:

```
fretboard
show frets=3,4,5,6 string=1
show frets=3,4,5 string=2 color=red
show fret=3 string=6 text=G
show notes=10/1,10/2,9/3,9/4
```
